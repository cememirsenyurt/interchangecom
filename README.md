Interchange.com is an imaginative online platform which aimed at facilitating peer-to-peer exchanges of goods and services. The platform is designed for us to leverage advanced data management and analysis techniques to enhance user experience and service efficiency to learn different query languages.

Database Design: Spearheaded the design of a comprehensive Entity-Relationship (ER) model to accurately represent the data structure and relationships inherent to the goods and services exchange ecosystem.

Data Engineering: Implemented a multi-database architecture to evaluate and compare performance across different data management systems including relational and NoSQL databases. This involved crafting and optimizing queries for:

PostgreSQL: Developed complex SQL queries to handle relational data operations, ensuring efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
Apache Cassandra: Engineered CQL queries tailored for high scalability and fault tolerance, optimizing for distributed data storage patterns.
MongoDB: Formulated BSON-based queries to leverage MongoDB's flexible document model for dynamic schema management.
Couchbase: Created N1QL and view-based queries in Couchbase, focusing on JSON document manipulation and real-time analytics.
Neo4j: Designed Cypher queries for Neo4j to exploit the power of graph databases in mapping intricate network relationships among users and their transactions.
Apache Spark: Utilized Spark's RDD and DataFrame APIs to perform large-scale data processing and analytics, enhancing data-driven decision-making capabilities.
Technical Documentation: Prepared comprehensive documentation detailing the ER model, query descriptions, and database-specific optimizations to facilitate knowledge transfer and system scalability.

Technology Stack: Employed a diverse set of technologies including PostgreSQL, Apache Cassandra, MongoDB, Couchbase, Neo4j, and Apache Spark to build a robust and scalable platform capable of supporting a wide range of user activities and analytical needs.
